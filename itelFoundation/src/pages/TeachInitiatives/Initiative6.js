          The significant problem of availability and affordability
        </p>
        <p>
          India, being the most populated country in the world, has a large
          number of people living with disabilities across all age groups. This
          often leaves them behind in many ways. Thankfully, we live in a time,
          where technology is steadily evolving to support both the disabled and
          the ageing population. Assistive technologies are helping people
          manage their challenges and lead independent, fulfilling lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of these technological advancements, however, have taken place in
          developed countries, where incomes are higher and affordability is
          less of an issue. The real challenge lies in making these solutions
          both available and affordable in India. Many of the latest innovations
          are not yet accessible here, and even when they are, the cost puts
          them out of reach for most people. This continues to be a major
          hurdle.

            India has a large pool of engineering talent. This means we have the
            opportunity to direct many skilled engineers towards efforts in
            assistive technology. ITEL’s aim is to tap into this talent by
            connecting engineers with researchers already working in the field,
            along with start-ups, to create solutions that are both affordable
            and accessible. The goal is to support people with different
            disabilities and the elderly who need assistance.

            Assisting to see through the barriers; Visual Impairment
          </p>
          <p>
            In India, a large number of people live with partial visual
            impairment that can often be corrected with a simple optometric
            assessment and a pair of glasses. In children, this can be
            facilitated by training school teachers to recognize and flag those
            showing signs of vision problems, after which CSR-supported programs
            can bring optometrists to villages to test these children and
            prescribe corrective lenses. Fortunately, glasses are available in
            India at a fairly low cost, and the prescribed glasses can be
            shipped to the children. For those who cannot afford even this
            meagre amount, one can use CSR to ensure they have it.
          </p>
          <p>
            To support individuals with more severe visual impairment, ITEL,
            together with its Incubatees, is developing AI-powered glasses that
            convert visual cues into voice inputs. Panoculon, an AI-powered
            smart glasses platform, is for this exact purpose. They can read out
            printed text from books, newspapers, and signboards, describe
            objects and surroundings, recognize familiar faces, and even guide
            users in navigation — all through simple voice prompts in the user’s
            native Indian languages
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond this, ITEL is committed to creating many more affordable and
            high-quality assistive technologies to improve daily living and
            ensure dignity and independence for those in need.

            An app designed to detect hearing disorders at an early age,
            providing timely identification and intervention services for
            children in rural and semi-urban communities. Developed in alignment
            with the SRESHT lab's focus on translational research, the app
            supports the meaningful integration of technology through
            tele-practice. This approach aims to bridge gaps in healthcare
            access, enabling early screening for children with hearing
            impairments, improving their quality of life.

          <p>
            In India, on average, five children are born every week in each
            district with hearing impairment. Yet, most are identified far too
            late—diagnosis often happens only after two years of age, and
            intervention even later. Early detection is critical since hearing
            impairment can affect speech development, as well as brain
            development. This, in turn impacts educational, psychosocial, and
            socioeconomic development of the child. To provide early
            intervention, it is imperative to identify these infants and measure
            the extent of the hearing impairment, preferably within a month.
            Early detection enables timely intervention, with a hearing aid or,
            in more complex cases, a cochlear implant, followed by therapy. The
            objective is to ensure intervention and support for children as
            early as possible.

            <b>Mobility Impairment & Rehabilitation</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Mobility impairments can arise from various causes such as cerebral
            palsy, stroke, spinal cord injuries, road traffic accidents,
            neurological disorders, and age-related decline. These conditions
            often lead to challenges in movement, strength, and independence,
            affecting overall quality of life. Rehabilitation and assistive
            technologies play a vital role in overcoming these challenges. They
            not only help restore motor function but also build strength,
            enhance mobility, and support long-term independence for individuals
            on their recovery journey.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            ITEL mission is to support individuals with mobility impairment,
            blend innovation, technology, and care to transform the way mobility
            and rehabilitation are experienced. Every device is designed with
            the user’s comfort, independence, and long-term well-being at the

          <p className="subHeading">Learning Disability:</p>
          <p>
            Learning Disability affects a child’s ability to learn, process
            information, and perform specific academic tasks, even when they
            have average or above-average intelligence. Examples include
            dyslexia, which involves difficulty with reading and language
            processing, and dyscalculia, which affects mathematical reasoning.
            These conditions require early identification and specialized
            interventions to help children reach their full academic potential.
          </p>
          <p>
            ITEL is focused on the early detection of children with Learning
            Disabilities. It is exploring the use of Optical Character
            Recognition (OCR)–based tools that can scan images or written text
            produced by children to flag potential signs of dyslexia. Such
            innovations can enable timely support, ensuring that children

          <p>
            Autism Spectrum Disorder is a neurological and developmental
            condition that affects how people interact, communicate, learn, and
            behave. Children and adolescents with ASD often face challenges in
            recognizing and processing emotions, understanding the pragmatics of
            language, and navigating social situations. These difficulties can
            contribute to heightened anxiety and reduced participation in
            everyday activities. Children with autism often want to be on their
            own, isolating themselves from others. They need someone who can
            understand them perfectly and empathise with them, simultaneously
            pushing them just a bit, so that they come out of their shell.
          </p>
          <p>
            ITEL is working to develop an AI-powered Avatar—a supportive “buddy”
            for individuals with autism, to do just this. The Avatar will be
            capable of adapting to the user’s emotional needs, encouraging them
            to expand their emotional boundaries gradually. Using conversational
            AI in multiple Indian languages, it will provide a safe,
            non-judgmental space for children and young adults with ASD to
            practice social interaction, emotional expression, and coping
