        <p className="Heading">Clean Energy</p>
        <p>
          Life on earth is slowly deteriorating as a result of greenhouse gas
          emissions. Over the last 250 years, we have been continuously burning
          fossil fuels, and in the process, exponentially increasing their use.
          All fossil fuels, whether they are coal, gas, or oil emit greenhouse
          gases that are steadily impacting life on our planet. If we want to
          reverse this damage, we have to reduce and ultimately stop using
          fossil fuels.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fortunately, we have alternatives. Renewable sources such as the sun
          can now be harnessed to generate electricity at a cost that is even
          lower than the electricity produced through coal and other fossil
          fuels. Other green energy options, including hydro, nuclear power, and
          biomass, can be utilised for generating electricity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Globally, the primary consumption of energy falls into three
          categories
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>heating</li>
          <li>cooling</li>
          <li>transport</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Fortunately, technologies exist for all these areas today, and they
          compare well with fossil fuel technologies. They are even financially
          viable. The challenge however lies in accelerating the transition into
          green energy at the earliest.
        </p>
        <p>
          One significant challenge with solar and wind-based electricity, which
          is by far the lowest-cost forms of energy available today, is their
          intermittency. Since they are not available 24x7, large-scale storage
          solutions are essential. Fortunately, the cost of storage has also
          fallen rapidly in recent years.

        <p>ITEL is today focused on developing technologies for</p>

          </li>
        </ol>
        <br />
        <p>
          Besides these, ITEL is leading a major program, which aims to redefine
          how heating and cooling systems operate, which happens to account for
          nearly 50% of the world's energy consumption today. ITEL is working to
          develop technologies required to produce Steel, Cement, Aluminium,
          Fertilizers and other such materials using green electricity or green
          hydrogen rather than fossil fuels
        </p>
        <p>
          ITEL is working on transforming the transport sector. HASHTIC City and
          HASHTIC Goods are two major initiatives aimed at transporting people
          within congested cities in under 20 minutes and goods across India
          within 24 hours, using green electricity. At the same time, ITEL
          continues to work with start-ups and industry to accelerate the
          adoption of electric vehicle
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="Heading">Next-generation Solar PV Technology</p>
        <p>
          Today, solar energy is converted to electricity using crystalline
          silicon technology. Crystalline silicon photovoltaic (PV) cells and
          panels are widely used today, as they offer low cost and good
          efficiency. However, currently the technology is fully controlled by
          China
        </p>
        <p>
          ITEL is therefore directing its efforts on developing next-generation
          solar PV technology called Perovskite. This technology is expected to
          deliver solar cells and panels at costs lower than current crystalline
          PV systems while offering significantly higher efficiency. Significant
          R&D efforts are already underway to advance this field.
        </p>
        <p>
          ITEL is collaborating with these researchers to scale their
          innovations into commercial products, so that India's dependence on
          imports of products and technology is substantially reduced.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="Heading">Grid-level Energy Storage</p>
        <p>
          Even though solar and wind-based electricity generation costs are
          lower than electricity from fossil fuels, their intermittent nature
          means that they cannot be generated continuously. Therefore, one needs
          efficient energy storage solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) battery cell prices have fallen rapidly
          in recent years, with cells now costing as low as $140 per kilowatt
          hour and delivering up to 10,000 charge-discharge cycles. The grid
          battery integrates these cells into large-scale battery packs.
          However, this technology remains largely controlled by China.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fortunately, the cell cost is only 50% of the total cost of the
          battery. The rest is for other components. Cygni Energy, a start-up
          associated with ITEL, has been actively developing cell-to-pack
          battery conversion technologies. Today, they are able to achieve this
          conversion, at costs that are competitive with Chinese imports
        </p>
        <p>
          India is currently ordering 10 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of grid storage, a
          figure that is likely to increase up to 200 GWh over the next 2 to 3
          years. ITEL will strive to ensure that Indian technology from cell to
          pack, scales and thrives in this rapidly growing market.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="Heading">Power Electronics</p>
        <p>
          Modern energy systems require power electronics, bi-directional
          converters, battery chargers, inverters, static synchronous
          compensator brackets (STATCOMs), and motor controllers to use
          electricity for different tasks. Over the last decade, the technology
          has evolved rapidly, and today Chinese products are available at
          extremely competitive prices.
        </p>
        <p>
          India has a large number of power electronics researchers, but most of
          them have remained focused on academic publications rather than
          commercialisation. To bridge this gap, ITEL has created a consortium
          of these product-focused researchers to develop all kinds of products,
          knowing that it has to compete with China on price while delivering
          the highest quality products of international standards. A diverse
          portfolio of products will need to be developed, scaled, and
          commercialised for widespread adoption. ITEL hopes to bring a large
          number of industries and start-ups associated with this consortium, to
          achieve this goal.
        </p>

        <br />
        <p className="Heading">Hydrogen Fuel Cell</p>
        <p>
          ITEL has undertaken a major initiative to develop fuel cells, which
          convert hydrogen to electricity. While the technology is available
          globally today, the costs remain high and efficiency is relatively
          low.
        </p>
        <p>
          ITEL has therefore established a consortium of researchers, start-ups,
          and industry to design and develop a fuel cell at a target cost of â‚¹
          50,000 per kilowatt and with at least 50% efficiency. While this
          remains a difficult task, the consortium has accepted this challenge
          and is committed to achieving this goal.
