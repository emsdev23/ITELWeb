        <p>
          The world is moving towards clean energy because fossil fuels pollute
          the air and cause climate change, making sustainable solutions a
          priority. Solar and wind power are excellent, but they don’t work all
          the time, so we need better battery storage like solid-state and
          sodium-ion batteries to store extra energy for later use.{" "}
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            New solar panel technology, like tandem perovskite solar cells, is
            making solar panels much more efficient and producing more power
            even in low sunlight.{" "}
          </li>
          <li>
            AI-powered smart grids can automatically balance electricity demand
            and supply, making sure energy isn’t wasted and blackouts are
            avoided.
          </li>
          <li>
            Green hydrogen for industries, like steel manufacturing, helps cut
            carbon emissions, making processes like Direct Reduced Iron (DRI)
            production much cleaner and more sustainable.
          </li>
          <li>
            Carbon capture technology can trap pollution from factories before
            it enters the air, reducing the damage industries cause to the
            environment.
          </li>
          <li>
            Turning garbage into energy is another smart solution, where organic
            waste is converted into biofuels and electricity, solving both waste
            management and energy production problems.
          </li>
          <li>
            Offshore wind turbines could help generate more clean power without
            taking up valuable land space.
          </li>
          <li>
            Electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming more efficient and affordable,
            and with more charging stations and better batteries, they will soon
            replace gas-powered cars entirely.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          By combining these technologies, we can create a world where energy is
          clean, reliable, and affordable, making pollution and fossil fuel
          dependence a thing of the past.
