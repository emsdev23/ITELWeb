          <p>
            A large section of Indian low-income people depends upon informal
            sources to borrow small amounts (₹20,000 to ₹50,000) as working
            capital for their nano-enterprises. They are charged interest rates
            (IR) varying between 36% to 60% per year. Over the last couple of
            decades, microfinance companies and NBFCs have emerged as formal
            financing structures for this segment and have reduced the interest
            rates to about 25%. Yet this is still too high for any venture to
            become sustainable.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            The high-interest rates are a result of the cost of financing, cost
            of risk, and cost of operations. For small loans today, the cost of
            risk and cost of operations (including follow-up for collection)
            itself amounts to about 12% or even more. This model works well when
            an experienced microfinance agent personally visits the home of the
            woman seeking a loan, interacts with her, and makes all kinds of
            queries for about 10 to 15 minutes to figure out the risk. Similar
            effort is required in follow-up, especially when the woman defaults.
          </p>
          <p>Can we use AI and communications to digitize this journey? </p>
          <br />
          <p className="subHeading">The Solution</p>
          <p>
            A "Virtual Didi/Akka," driven by AI, could visit the home of the
            woman seeking a loan using a WhatsApp video call and talk to her in
            the local language and dialect. The AI system will listen to each
            answer, simultaneously analysing the face and expression of the
            woman as she utters words, while also analysing any available data
            about her past transactions and defaults, to keep coming up with the
            next question to compute the risk.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            Similar calls, but with different logic, could be used for
            collection.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            With digital payments (like UPI) already in vogue, this could reduce
            the risk and operation costs to 3 to 4%, making loans at about 15%
            IR possible.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            This could revolutionize the FINTECH for Inclusion. This is one of
            the many Tech leadership initiatives ITEL is currently working on.{" "}
