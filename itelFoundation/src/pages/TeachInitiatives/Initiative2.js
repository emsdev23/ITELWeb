            Heating and cooling account for around 50% of the world's total
            energy consumption today, with most of this energy being derived
            from fossil fuels like coal, gas, and oil. The greenhouse gas
            emissions from these fossil fuel-based systems are a major
            contributor to climate change, making it an urgent global challenge.
            There is an urgent need to shift towards greener sources of energy,
            such as renewable electricity, for meeting our heating and cooling
            demands. However, a deeper look at the fundamental principles of
            thermodynamics reveals how one can best utilize energy for heating
            and cooling and maximise efficiency. For example, an electric kettle
            uses 1 kWh of electricity to generate less than 1 unit of heat. In
            contrast, heat pump and chiller technologies that leverage the
            Carnot cycle (compression and expansion of refrigerants), can
            generate about 4 units of heat and 4 units of cooling using just 1
            unit of electricity, achieving a Coefficient of Performance (COP) of
            8 or higher. While modern refrigerators and air conditioners do
            leverage these heat pump principles, the waste heat or cold air is
            often simply discharged into the environment. By redesigning the
            heating and cooling systems to better utilize and store this thermal
            energy when needed and using it later, significant improvements in
            overall efficiency can be achieved. As India's economy continues to
            grow rapidly, the country will undertake massive construction and
            infrastructure development in the coming years. This presents a
            unique opportunity to deploy these innovative, high-efficiency
            heating and cooling technologies at scale within India. If
            successful, India could potentially become a global leader in
            affordable and sustainable solutions for meeting the world's heating
            and cooling needs, with the potential to significantly reduce
            greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption in this sector.{" "}
