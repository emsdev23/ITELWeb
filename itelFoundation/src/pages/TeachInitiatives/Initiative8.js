          Cybersecurity is an area where, India should be self-reliant and not
          depend on any other country. India, with its largest population in the
          world, must have its own solutions. Our country must become capable of
          developing Indian-designed products and solutions, with end-to-end
          service capabilities, to build a solid foundation for a secure digital
          future
        </p>
        <p>
          Data of each individual, each company and each department of State and
          Central Government must be secure, not only from external attackers,
          but from internal risks as well. To build such solutions, one needs to
          strengthen scientists and researchers, start-ups, and the industry,
          ensuring that we do not depend on external expertise.

            As a first step, we bring researchers and scientists to work
            together. We have thus enabled an{" "}
            <b>Indian Cybersecurity Academic Network (ICAN),</b> consisting of
            scientists, researchers and experts at academic institutions in
            India. While ICAN will be the central pillar, the broader program is
            aimed at bringing industry and the government together, to build
            India’s cybersecurity infrastructure and strengthen our nation’s
            digital sovereignty.

          <p className="subHeading">Rising Cyberthreats:</p>
          <p>
            The nature, scale, and complexity of cyber threats are increasing,
            as we transform into a digital nation. These threats, whether they
            are ransomware, phishing, data breaches, or sophisticated attacks on
            critical infrastructure are real for individuals, corporates,
            industries, institutions, and the Government alike.
          </p>
          <p>
            As digital adoption increases in the country, it has become
            imperative for India to have strong and resilient protection against
            cyber threats. As the country embraces the digital route for
            critical services such as identity creation (Aadhaar) and payments
            (UPI), in addition to AI and IoT, the risk is further enhanced.
          </p>
          <p>
            This digital ecosystem, which is evolving constantly, is adding new
            layers of risk. This mandates that as a country, we build a security
            infrastructure that is not only strong and flexible, but also agile
            for constant updates. We are today dependent on solutions created
            outside India to protect our digital infrastructure and this leaves
            serious gaps for adversaries to exploit.
          </p>
          <p>
            Adding to this, India faces a massive shortage of trained
            professionals, who are skilled to address this growing challenge.
            There is an urgent need for the country to scale up its academic and
            R&D efforts to address these challenges

            Our goal is to create an all-encompassing approach to strengthen
            India’s cybersecurity infrastructure by bringing together academia,
            industry, experts, institutions, and governments to build an
            indigenous ecosystem that strengthens India’s cyber infrastructure,
            by improving capabilities and reducing vulnerabilities.

            Indian Cyber Security Academic Network aims to be a catalyst and
            multiplier, which brings together academia, industry, experts,
            start-ups, technologists, and government to build a strong,
            resilient, yet agile cybersecurity infrastructure that is indigenous
            and secures India’s digital future.

            Through ICAN, we are building an all-encompassing ecosystem, with
            focus on three major areas:

            <li>
              <p>
                <b>Faculty Training Program:</b>Through this initiative, we are
                training the trainers (faculty) to nurture and transform budding
                engineers into talented cybersecurity professionals. The
                intensive 8 to10-day online program, followed by 8 to 10-day
                in-person program, including hands-on experience, is being
                conducted twice a year in summer and winter at different IITs
                and IIITs.
              </p>
              <p>
                This program, which trains faculty from tier-2 engineering
                colleges and research scholars, is led by faculty from IIT
                Madras, IIT Bombay, IIT Kanpur, IIIT Hyderabad, and IIIT Delhi.
                Through this program, ICAN aims to equip the faculty with the
                right curriculum and tools to impart knowledge to talented
                engineers, so that they can inspire the next generation of
                engineers to become cybersecurity professionals.

                <b>Industry Academia Collaboration:</b>We will create a platform
                for industry and academia to identify and address real-world
                security challenges in the digital space. The platform will also
                support SMEs that lack dedicated resources by providing them
                with the knowledge to create safe and secure digital frameworks
                to protect their businesses.
              </p>
              <p>
                The focus will be to create Indian-designed product development
                and commercialisation. In addition, plans are underway to
                collaborate with the industry and experts to create short
                courses on real-world cybersecurity practices that will help
                onboard employees. This program is aimed at start-ups and SMEs

            <li>
              <p>
                <b>Government:</b>ICAN will work closely with the Government on
                policy reforms, to safeguard and strengthen critical digital
                infrastructure. In addition, we will work with industry and
                cybersecurity experts to nurture and guide start-ups to design
                and develop innovative security frameworks to protect India’s
                digital space.

            Through our Faculty Training Program, we have already begun training
            faculty. The first program was held at IIT Madras, with 180 faculty
            members and research scholars attending from across India. The team
            is currently working towards scaling the training program to reach
            and train more trainers, and support many more educational
            institutions, specifically the tier-2 educational institutions that
            need support.
